## Bad Code Effort

Thought: 

> A working mess is better than nothing.
>
> We will go back and clean it up.

Truth:

>Later Equals Never.

Effort:

> Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall. There is no way to clean it up.
>
> As a effort, the productivity decrease, the manager try to add more staffs to the project in hopes of increasing productivity.
>
> But the new staffs dont know the the diff between a change that match the design intent and thwart it.

Result:

> The Grand Redesign in the Sky
>
> It add a new team to rebuild the whole system while the old team still need to maintain the old system until the new system can finish all works the old system can do.
>
> It take years, and at that time, a new Grand Redesign may be on the plan.

Reason:

> WE, as a programmer, are unprofessional.
>
> WE blame all these on manager, customer, but the real reason is that we are unprofessional.
>
> WE allow mess to catch the deadline, but in fact, the mess slow us.
